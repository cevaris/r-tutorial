# Define two example numbers
A <- 10
B <- 5

# Sum up the value of A and B, and assign to C variable
C <- A + B
# By just typing "C" and executing that line, the value of C is printed out
C


var1 <- 2.5
var2 <- 4

# divide value of var1 by value of var2
result <- var1 / var2
result # should return 0.625


# call the builtin function "sqrt", passing in var2
answer <- sqrt(var2)
answer # should be 2, because sqrt(4) = 2


# Define a string variable, with value "Hello"
greeting <- "Hello"
name <- "Bob"

# using the builtin "paste" function we join 
# greeting and name string values into a single string.
message <- paste(greeting, name)
